<h2 id="whats-a-schedplot">What’s a Schedplot?</h2>
<p>Schedplot (__sched__uler __plot__ter) is a profiler for Erlang programs I developed for my thesis during the last year. It visualizes the workload of Erlang’s schedulers, which can be used to detect bottlenecks and scalability issues in multicore architectures.</p>
<p>In other words, Schedplot aspires to answer a simple question: why a program doesn’t run twice as fast if the number of available processors is doubled?</p>
<h2 id="this-sounds-familiar-to">This sounds familiar to…</h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope">Threadscope (Haskell)</a>. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd627193%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">Threads View (VS)</a>. <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/realtime/TSV/JavaRTS-TSV.html">Thread Scheduling Visualizer (Java)</a>. Indeed! But isn’t it awesome that Erlang has schedulers instead of threads? Threadplot just doesn’t sound right…</p>
<p>## Schedplot example So, without further ado, here’s a screenshot:</p>

<p>The profiled program spawns 5 processes: each one calculates a Fibonacci number (28, 29, 30, 31, 32). The program runs in a VM using 4 schedulers (S1-S4). It is trivial to realize why the program doesn’t have ideal speedup; although we have more than 4 processes, their work load is unbalanced and 3 schedulers are inactive while the 4th calculates fib(32)</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-know-that-the-last-one-is-fib32">How do you know that the last one is fib(32)?</h3>
<p>Well, see that red line at the end with the <code>end32</code> label? That’s the result of using <code>schedplot:print/1</code>, which prints a message on the graph (the message is placed on the scheduler on which the process that called it was running). In our case, when a process has finished the calculations it prints <code>endN</code> where N is the Fibonacci number it was calculating.</p>

<p>Well, no, not really lazy. Each pixel is corresponds not to a single moment (1us); hence, in 10us a scheduler may be inactive for 5us and active for 5us and will be displayed as 50% active.</p>
<h3 id="what-will-happen-if-in-100us-the-scheduler-is-99-active-but-the-chart-height-is-10pixel">What will happen if in 100us the scheduler is 99% active but the chart height is 10pixel?</h3>
<p>It will be 9 pixel. The graph has max height if and only if the scheduler is 100% active; otherwise, the visualization could hide significant gaps.</p>
<p>Symmetrically, the height is zero if and only if the scheduler is 0% active.</p>
